DoorLock is a remote locking system built for a Raspberry Pi.

It will eventually be a JSON-only API that will take authenticated requests from pre-created users to lock/unlock a door, check the open/closed status of the door, schedule lock times, and give temporary "keys" to other users.

When it gets closer to finished, I'll publish a circuit diagram for the lock mechanism
